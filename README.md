# Digital-high-speed-circuits
High-speed rotating shafts are used as power for various applications such as agricultural semiconductors and robotics. The encoder is a sensor that converts the angular position of rotation into digital signals. As the speed and control accuracy of high-speed axes become more and more required. Ordinary digital circuits become unable to handle these digital signals accurately. This project aims to design a high-speed digital circuit to process the digital signals from encoders (20,000rpm). This circuit is capable of handling signals generated by high-speed encoders with synchronous or asynchronous frames. Also, the maximum reliable speed and robustness to noise of this circuit will be tested.
The project is broadly divided into two major milestones. The first milestone is the simulation of the circuit. Requires switching between different rate digital input positions to read out the rate and pulses per revolution of encoder. The second milestone is the building of a real-world FPGA-based circuit. Synchronize and antiphase pendulums are used to drive real-world encoders.
